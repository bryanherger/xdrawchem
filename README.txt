Welcome to XDrawChem!

This package conatins two versions of XDrawChem:

xdrawchem - this is the main development version.  It is based on Qt 3.x.

xdrawchem-qt4 - this is a contributed version.  It is based on Qt 4.
   Eventually, this will become the main version, but most distributions
   are still based on Qt 3.  The Qt 4 version is the basis of WinDrawChem.

Enjoy!
